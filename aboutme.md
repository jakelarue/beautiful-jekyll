### Why Jake?

When you need to fly, you board a plane... 

When you need an oil change, you call a mechanic...

When you need to get more clicks, a lift in conversions and bottom-line boosting copy...

**I'm your guy.**

- I move quickly, break stuff and **TEST EVERYTHING**
- I follow a **pretty straight-forward, refined process that eliminates the bullshit** - tested and proven to be effective and efficient - so you won't ever get lost in the sauce and you're *always in-the-know*
- 2+ years of **copywriting, conversion optimization and digital marketing experience**
- Invested over **4,600 hours** into learning and practicing how to craft copy that sells the shit out of your products and services 
- **Certified Conversion Copywriter** - Copy Hackers (10x Landing Pages, 10x Emails and 10x Launches)
- **Conversion Rate Optimization Masterclass Alumni** - Craig Sullivan & ConversionXL
- **Certified Growth-Driven Design Expert** - Hubspot
- Extremely scrappy and well-versed in **market & messaging research, qualitative & quantitive data, UX/UI design and A/B Testing**
- Deep and clear understanding of human buying patterns 
- I use **data-driven research to study the behaviors, mindsets, emotions and needs of your target audience**
- You get an **organized, highly-proactive, entrepreneurial-spirited, conversion-getting hustler** that hits deadlines and **produces bottom-line boosting copy** - without the micromanaging headaches you loathe 
- I could work collaboratively with your team of stakeholders, designers and developers - or I could fly solo - either way, **you could bet the house that I'm the sure shot you need**

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
