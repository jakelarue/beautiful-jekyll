title: Hi, I'm Jake 
subtitle: A conversion optimization consultant who writes copy
---


I've been a copywriter since early 2015 - first for my own projects/businesses, and later for local SMBs and service companies, as well as numerous entrepreneurs and consultants. 

A few things you should know about me:

- I write for results: clicks and cash - not passion
- I like to deal straight. No bullshit. No cutting corners.
- I write for my own businesses as well, so you're not dealing with a charlatan - I actually drink my own kool-aid 
- Four years ago, I made the best (and the scariest) decision of my life: Dropping out of college and diving face-first into the real world without any skills
