title: Hi, I'm Jake 
subtitle: A conversion optimization consultant who writes copy
---

Everybody has a *"guy"*...

A guy for the car... 

A guy for the lastest sports picks...

A guy for all that techy sh*t you don't understand or feel like learning... 

But what about when sales are down, you're out-of-touch with your audience and your marketing strategies just aren't cutting it...

Sure, you can hire a fancy-sounding writer. But that won't put more bucks in the bank. 

When you need someone to actually bring in more sales and generate a better ROI...

### You'll need to hire a conversion copywriter

And guess who's in the business of **getting more clicks, increasing conversions** and **delivering bottom-line boosting results?**

<br>


I've been a copywriter since early 2015 - first for my own projects/businesses, and later for local SMBs and service companies, as well as numerous entrepreneurs and consultants. 

A few things you should know about me:

- I write for results: clicks and cash - not passion
- I like to deal straight. No bullshit. No cutting corners.
- I write for my own businesses as well, so you're not dealing with a charlatan - I actually drink my own kool-aid 
- Dropping out of college was one of the best decisions I made in my life 
- And I'm a heavy cryptocurrency enthusiast that loves to take random road trips and play poker


### Why am I a sure shot?


- I move quickly, break stuff and **TEST EVERYTHING**
- 2+ years of **copywriting, conversion optimization and digital marketing experience**
- Over **4,600 hours** and **$6,500+** into learning and practicing how to craft copy that sells the shit out of your products and services 
- **Certified Conversion Copywriter** - Copy Hackers (10x Landing Pages, 10x Emails and 10x Launches)
- **Conversion Rate Optimization Masterclass Alumni** - Craig Sullivan & ConversionXL
- **Certified Growth-Driven Design Expert** - Hubspot
- You get an **organized, highly-proactive, entrepreneurial-spirited, conversion-getting hustler** that hits deadlines and **produces bottom-line boosting copy** - without the micromanaging headaches you loathe 
- I follow a **pretty straight-forward, refined process that eliminates the bullshit** - tested and proven to be effective and efficient - so you won't ever get lost in the sauce and you're *always in-the-know*
- Extremely scrappy and well-versed in **market & messaging research, qualitative & quantitive data, UX/UI design and A/B Testing**
- I've developed a deep understanding of human buying patterns and customer psychology and use **data-driven research to study the behaviors, mindsets, emotions** and **needs of your target audience**
- I could work collaboratively with your team of stakeholders, designers and developers - or I could fly solo
