## So you've made the call

You wanna get the ball rolling and boost your bottom-line. 

### Hold your horses - this isn't for everyone...

After a year or so, I learned (the hard way) that providing a great ROI isn't easy. 

Most people think: "Just make it grow"

Uh, no. It does **not** work like that. 

If you're looking for a silver bullet solution - I'm not your guy. 

If you're **not** willing to put in the work - I'm not your guy. 

If you don't *really* know your numbers (aov, ltv, revenue & business goals) **or** feel uncomfortable sharing that type of information - say it with me... I'm not your guy. 

If you think I just write words and *vioala* - sales - I'm not your guy. 


### But we might be a fit if the following are true:

- You have a good, solid product or service and a great reputation
- Your business makes over **$100,000 in annual revenue**
- You **MUST** follow directions. (Don't worry, I won't ask you to do anything weird.)
- 



**Note:** I *don't* write blog posts, but I can point you in the direction of some kick-ass content writers, just ask

### Terms:

- Payments are made via Stripe, Paypal or bank transfer 
- A **$499 non-refundable deposit** gets you a slot on my calendar 
- Any projects under **$1,500 USD** are paid in advance _before_ any work is started
- 

Sounds good? Ok great. Keep reading...
