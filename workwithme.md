## So you've made the call

You wanna get the ball rolling and boost your bottom-line. 

### Hold your horses - this isn't for everyone...

Most people think: "Just make it grow". Uh, no. It does **not** work like that. 

I learned (the hard way) that providing a great ROI isn't easy. 

I say that, to say this - if you are:
- Looking for a silver bullet solution - I'm not your guy. 
- **Not** willing to put in the work, even after we're done with a project - I'm not your guy. 
- Thinking I just write words and *vioala* sales - I'm not your guy. 

And if you don't *really* know your numbers (aov, ltv, revenue & business goals) **or** feel uncomfortable sharing that information - yup, you guessed it... I'm not your guy. 

I like digging into businesses, learning the ins-and-outs to find out how we can take your marketing to the next level. 

After a while, I got a feel for which type of clients would benefit the most from my work. I had to become **VERY PICKY** about who I could help, so I came up with a strict (but reasonable) set of criteria that needs to be met in order for us to move forward.

### We might be a fit if the following are true:

- You have a good, solid product or service and a great reputation
- You must have a steady flow of leads and customers - ideally **15,000 unique vistors**
- Your business makes over **$100,000 in annual revenue**
- You **MUST** follow directions. (Don't worry, I won't ask you to do anything weird.)
- 


That's it! Those are all my requirements. Still with me? Good. Keep reading...


**Note:** I *don't* write blog posts, but I can point you in the direction of some kick-ass content writers, just ask.

### Terms:

- Payments are made via Stripe, Paypal or bank transfer 
- A **$499 non-refundable deposit** gets you a slot on my calendar 
- Any projects under **$1,500 USD** are paid in advance _before_ any work is started
- 

Sounds good? Ok great. Keep reading...
